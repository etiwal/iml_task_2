To make new predictions for grading follow the steps below:
1. replace the file test_features.csv with the new test_features.csv
2. a) run the prediction with the command: python3 main.py (recommended)
   b) run the prediction with the command: python3 main.py --retrain_model
      --> this will retrain the models for the prediction from scratch
3. when finished the predictions are stored in "submission.csv" and "submission.zip"
